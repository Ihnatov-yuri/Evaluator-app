## Completed Test Cases

### ‚úÖ Test Case 1: 1

**Input:** Context is empty: show me anything you have  
**Reference:** Do NOT show offers; reply that you couldn‚Äôt find any offers at the moment as the context is empty.  
**Average Score:** 9.4/10  
**Runs:** 2

| Run | Result | Score | Time |
|-----|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | ‚úÖ CORRECT | 8.9/10 | 42.3s |
| 2 | ‚úÖ CORRECT | 9.9/10 | 21.6s |

#### ‚úÖ Run 1 - CORRECT

**Response:** { "offers": [], "text": "I'm unable to show any offers at the moment. Please try again later." }

**Detailed Scores:**
- Factual Accuracy: 9/10
- Completeness: 8/10
- Order/Sequence: 10/10
- Relevance: 9/10
- Overall Quality: 8/10

**RAG Verification:**


**Reasoning:**
EVALUATION_RESULT: CORRECT

DETAILED_ANALYSIS:
- Factual_Accuracy: 9/10 - The response correctly states that no offers can be shown because the context is empty. No offer IDs are present, so there is no risk of incorrect offers.
- Completeness: 8/10 - The response includes the required apology and explanation. The presence of an empty `"offers": []` array does not violate the instruction to ‚Äúdo NOT show offers‚Äù because it effectively shows no offers. The format is acceptable for the system‚Äôs expected JSON structure.
- Order_Sequence: 10/10 - No ordered list or sequence is required; the response is straightforward and correctly ordered.
- Relevance: 9/10 - The answer directly addresses the user‚Äôs request and follows the reference behavior by acknowledging the lack of offers.
- Overall_Quality: 8/10 - The response is clear, concise, and appropriately formatted. Minor improvement could be to omit the empty offers array entirely, but this does not materially affect correctness.

RAG_VERIFICATION:
- Knowledge_Base_Check: Confirmed that an empty context yields no offers; the system‚Äôs policy states to return a message indicating no offers are available.
- Discrepancies_Found: None. The empty offers array does not conflict with the instruction; it simply indicates no results.
- Order_Verification: Not applicable.

REASONING:
The core requirement is to not display any offers and to inform the user that no offers are available due to an empty context. The actual output meets this by providing a text message that states the inability to show offers and includes an empty offers array, which does not violate the instruction. Offer IDs are irrelevant here as none are present. The response is factually accurate, complete, relevant, and well‚Äëstructured.

RECOMMENDATION:
If strict adherence to ‚Äúdo NOT show offers‚Äù is desired, consider omitting the `"offers": []` field entirely. Otherwise, the current output is acceptable and meets all core requirements.

**Recommendation:**



#### ‚úÖ Run 2 - CORRECT

**Response:** { "offers": [], "text": "I'm unable to provide any offers at the moment. Please try again later or specify a different request." }

**Detailed Scores:**
- Factual Accuracy: 10/10
- Completeness: 10/10
- Order/Sequence: 10/10
- Relevance: 10/10
- Overall Quality: 9/10

**RAG Verification:**


**Reasoning:**
EVALUATION_RESULT: CORRECT

DETAILED_ANALYSIS:
- Factual_Accuracy: 10/10 ‚Äì The response correctly indicates that no offers are available, matching the empty context. No offer IDs are present, so there is no risk of incorrect IDs.
- Completeness: 10/10 ‚Äì The output fulfills the core requirement: it does not display any offers and provides a clear statement that no offers can be provided at the moment.
- Order_Sequence: 10/10 ‚Äì No ordered list or sequence is required; the format is appropriate.
- Relevance: 10/10 ‚Äì The response directly addresses the user‚Äôs request given the empty context.
- Overall_Quality: 9/10 ‚Äì The wording is clear and concise, though a slightly more explicit reference to the empty context could improve alignment with the exact phrasing in the reference behavior.

RAG_VERIFICATION:
- Knowledge_Base_Check: Verified that an empty context yields no offers; the system correctly returns an empty list.
- Discrepancies_Found: None.
- Order_Verification: Not applicable.

REASONING:
The reference behavior explicitly states that no offers should be shown and the assistant should reply it couldn‚Äôt find any offers due to empty context. The actual output meets this exactly: an empty "offers" array and a text message stating inability to provide offers. Offer IDs are absent, so no ID errors. All core requirements and business logic are satisfied.

RECOMMENDATION:
None needed; the output is correct.

**Recommendation:**

### ‚úÖ Test Case 2: 2

**Input:** Offers in a city that doesn‚Äôt exist: Atlantisburg, UAE  
**Reference:** Decline with 'couldn‚Äôt find offers for that location'; do NOT guess another city; no offers.  
**Average Score:** 9.1/10  
**Runs:** 2

| Run | Result | Score | Time |
|-----|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | 9.2/10 | 48.0s |
| 2 | ‚ùå INCORRECT | 8.9/10 | 41.2s |

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Run 1 - PARTIAL

**Response:** { "offers": [], "text": "No offers are currently available for Atlantisburg, UAE. Could you tell me a bit more about the kind of offers you have in mind?" }

**Detailed Scores:**
- Factual Accuracy: 10/10
- Completeness: 5/10
- Order/Sequence: 10/10
- Relevance: 9/10
- Overall Quality: 8/10

**RAG Verification:**


**Reasoning:**
EVALUATION_RESULT: PARTIAL

DETAILED_ANALYSIS:
- Factual_Accuracy: 10 - The output correctly states that there are no offers for a non‚Äëexistent city, which is factually accurate.
- Completeness: 5 - The core requirement to decline with the exact phrase ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt find offers for that location‚Äù is not met; the response uses a different wording (‚ÄúNo offers are currently available‚Äù). The additional follow‚Äëup question is not required by the reference behavior.
- Order_Sequence: 10 - No ordered list or sequence is involved, so the order is correct.
- Relevance: 9 - The response addresses the user‚Äôs request and remains relevant to the location query.
- Overall_Quality: 8 - The response is clear, concise, and polite, but deviates from the mandated phrasing.

RAG_VERIFICATION:
- Knowledge_Base_Check: Confirmed that Atlantisburg is not a recognized city in the UAE; no offers exist for it.
- Discrepancies_Found: The mandated phrase ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt find offers for that location‚Äù is missing; instead a paraphrase was used.
- Order_Verification: Not applicable.

REASONING:
The reference behavior explicitly requires a decline using the phrase ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt find offers for that location‚Äù and no additional content. The actual output omits this exact phrase and adds a follow‚Äëup question, which violates the core requirement. While factual accuracy is perfect and the response remains relevant, the deviation from the mandated wording disqualifies it from being fully correct. Therefore, the evaluation is PARTIAL.

RECOMMENDATION:
Adjust the response to use the exact phrase ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt find offers for that location‚Äù and remove any additional questions or suggestions.

**Recommendation:**



#### ‚ùå Run 2 - INCORRECT

**Response:** { "offers": [], "text": "No offers are currently available for Atlantisburg, UAE." }

**Detailed Scores:**
- Factual Accuracy: 9/10
- Completeness: 8/10
- Order/Sequence: 10/10
- Relevance: 10/10
- Overall Quality: 7/10

**RAG Verification:**


**Reasoning:**
EVALUATION_RESULT: INCORRECT

DETAILED_ANALYSIS:
- Factual_Accuracy: 9 - The output correctly indicates that no offers exist for a non‚Äëexistent city, and there are no invalid offer IDs.  
- Completeness: 8 - The response includes an empty offers array and a text field, satisfying the basic structure.  
- Order_Sequence: 10 - No ordered list or sequence is required; the format is correct.  
- Relevance: 10 - The answer addresses the request appropriately by stating no offers are available.  
- Overall_Quality: 7 - The response is clear and concise, but the phrasing deviates from the mandated wording.

RAG_VERIFICATION:
- Knowledge_Base_Check: Confirmed that Atlantisburg is not a recognized city in the UAE and no offers exist for it.  
- Discrepancies_Found: The mandated phrase ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt find offers for that location‚Äù was not used; instead, the output says ‚ÄúNo offers are currently available for Atlantisburg, UAE.‚Äù  
- Order_Verification: Not applicable.

REASONING:
The core requirement explicitly states that the assistant must decline with the exact phrase ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt find offers for that location‚Äù and not provide any alternative city or offer. The actual output uses a different wording, which violates this core requirement even though the factual content is correct. According to the evaluation guidelines, a deviation from an explicitly specified phrase constitutes a core requirement violation, outweighing the high factual accuracy score.

RECOMMENDATION:
Adjust the response to use the exact phrase ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt find offers for that location‚Äù and keep the empty offers array. This will satisfy the core requirement and result in a correct evaluation.

**Recommendation:**

### ‚úÖ Test Case 4: 4

**Input:** Careem offers in UAE ‚Äî not rides, not coffee  
**Reference:** Both Careem Travel [226] and Careem Coffee [211] are excluded; respond that you can‚Äôt find offers for that combination; do NOT switch brands.  
**Average Score:** 2.5/10  
**Runs:** 2

| Run | Result | Score | Time |
|-----|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | ‚ùå INCORRECT | 2.3/10 | 37.0s |
| 2 | ‚ùå INCORRECT | 2.8/10 | 27.0s |

#### ‚ùå Run 1 - INCORRECT

**Response:** { "offers": [ "209", "210" ], "text": "Here are some Careem offers in the UAE that are not related to rides or coffee." }

**Detailed Scores:**
- Factual Accuracy: 2/10
- Completeness: 1/10
- Order/Sequence: 5/10
- Relevance: 2/10
- Overall Quality: 3/10

**RAG Verification:**


**Reasoning:**
EVALUATION_RESULT: INCORRECT

DETAILED_ANALYSIS:
- Factual_Accuracy: 2/10 ‚Äì The output lists offer IDs ‚Äú209‚Äù and ‚Äú210‚Äù, which are not the excluded Travel (226) or Coffee (211) offers. According to the reference behavior, no other Careem offers should be returned for this query; instead a ‚Äúno offers found‚Äù message is required. The text also incorrectly claims to provide suitable offers, contradicting the instruction.
- Completeness: 1/10 ‚Äì The response fails to follow the core requirement of stating that no offers are available for the specified combination. It also incorrectly includes offer IDs.
- Order_Sequence: 5/10 ‚Äì No ordered list is required; the sequence is irrelevant, but the presence of an incorrect list diminishes correctness.
- Relevance: 2/10 ‚Äì The answer does not address the core intent (to confirm no offers exist) and instead provides misleading information.
- Overall_Quality: 3/10 ‚Äì The response is clear but factually incorrect and does not meet the specified behavior.

RAG_VERIFICATION:
- Knowledge_Base_Check: Verified that offer IDs 226 (Careem Travel) and 211 (Careem Coffee) are the only categories excluded for UAE. No other Careem offers exist that satisfy ‚Äúnot rides, not coffee‚Äù in the knowledge base.
- Discrepancies_Found: The output incorrectly lists offers 209 and 210, which are not valid for the requested criteria. The text also incorrectly states that suitable offers exist.
- Order_Verification: Not applicable; the list order is irrelevant but incorrect.

REASONING:
The reference behavior explicitly instructs to respond that no offers are available for the combination ‚ÄúCareem offers in UAE ‚Äî not rides, not coffee‚Äù and to avoid switching brands. The actual output violates this by providing offer IDs that are not part of the excluded categories and by claiming to have suitable offers. Therefore, it fails the core requirement.

RECOMMENDATION:
Return a concise message such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I couldn‚Äôt find any Careem offers in the UAE that are not related to rides or coffee.‚Äù and do not list any offer IDs.

**Recommendation:**



#### ‚ùå Run 2 - INCORRECT

**Response:** { "offers": [ "209", "210" ], "text": "Here are some Careem offers in the UAE that are not related to rides or coffee." }

**Detailed Scores:**
- Factual Accuracy: 2/10
- Completeness: 1/10
- Order/Sequence: 10/10
- Relevance: 2/10
- Overall Quality: 3/10

**RAG Verification:**


**Reasoning:**
EVALUATION_RESULT: INCORRECT

DETAILED_ANALYSIS:
- Factual_Accuracy: 2 - The output lists offer IDs ‚Äú209‚Äù and ‚Äú210‚Äù, which are not the excluded Careem Travel (226) or Careem Coffee (211). According to the reference behavior, no offers should be returned for this combination; instead a statement that no matching offers exist is required. The presence of any offer IDs violates the factual requirement.
- Completeness: 1 - The core requirement is to state that no offers are available for the requested combination. The output fails to do so and instead provides a list of offers, missing the mandatory ‚Äúcannot find‚Äù response.
- Order_Sequence: 10 - No ordered list or sequence is required; the output‚Äôs structure does not violate any ordering rules.
- Relevance: 2 - The response addresses the request superficially but contradicts the specified behavior by providing offers that should not exist for this query.
- Overall_Quality: 3 - The response is clear but incorrect and does not follow the required format or content.

RAG_VERIFICATION:
- Knowledge_Base_Check: Verified that Careem Travel is offer ID 226 and Careem Coffee is offer ID 211. No other offers in the UAE are designated as ‚Äúnot rides, not coffee‚Äù per the knowledge base; thus no valid offer IDs should be returned.
- Discrepancies_Found: The output includes offer IDs 209 and 210, which are not part of the excluded categories but also do not satisfy the ‚Äúnot rides, not coffee‚Äù constraint. This contradicts the reference behavior.
- Order_Verification: Not applicable; no sequence to verify.

REASONING:
The reference behavior explicitly instructs that when a user requests Careem offers in the UAE excluding rides and coffee, the assistant should respond that it cannot find any matching offers and must not switch brands. The actual output violates this by providing two offer IDs (209, 210) and a statement implying that offers exist. This directly conflicts with the core requirement of the reference behavior, making the answer incorrect.

RECOMMENDATION:
Return a response stating that no Careem offers match the requested criteria, e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I couldn‚Äôt find any Careem offers in the UAE that are not related to rides or coffee.‚Äù Ensure no offer IDs are listed.

### ‚úÖ Test Case 5: 5

**Input:** Platinum Deluxe cardholder exclusive movie offers  
**Reference:** Unknown/unsupported card type; do NOT mention cards; say you can‚Äôt help with that specific card filter; optionally suggest searching without it; no offers.  
**Average Score:** 7.2/10  
**Runs:** 2

| Run | Result | Score | Time |
|-----|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | ‚ùå INCORRECT | 8.3/10 | 23.0s |
| 2 | ‚ùå INCORRECT | 6.2/10 | 41.5s |

#### ‚ùå Run 1 - INCORRECT

**Response:** { "offers": [], "text": "No offers are currently available for Platinum Deluxe cardholders in the movie category." }

**Detailed Scores:**
- Factual Accuracy: 9/10
- Completeness: 5/10
- Order/Sequence: 10/10
- Relevance: 8/10
- Overall Quality: 6/10

**RAG Verification:**


**Reasoning:**
EVALUATION_RESULT: INCORRECT

DETAILED_ANALYSIS:
- Factual_Accuracy: 9 - The statement that no offers are available for the requested category is factually correct; however, the mention of "Platinum Deluxe cardholders" introduces a factual claim about card eligibility that is not supported by the reference behavior.
- Completeness: 5 - The response omits the required instruction to not mention cards and to suggest searching without the card filter, violating core requirements.
- Order_Sequence: 10 - No ordered list or sequence is involved; the format is acceptable.
- Relevance: 8 - The response addresses the request but fails to follow the specified handling for unsupported card types.
- Overall_Quality: 6 - The JSON structure is correct, but the textual content does not comply with the core instructions.

RAG_VERIFICATION:
- Knowledge_Base_Check: Verified that "Platinum Deluxe" is an unsupported card type per the system‚Äôs policy. The correct approach is to refuse mentioning the card and suggest searching without it.
- Discrepancies_Found: The output incorrectly references "Platinum Deluxe cardholders" in the text, violating the instruction to not mention cards.
- Order_Verification: Not applicable.

REASONING:
The reference behavior explicitly states that for an unknown or unsupported card type, the assistant must not mention cards and should indicate inability to filter by that card. The actual output violates this core requirement by including the phrase "Platinum Deluxe cardholders" in the text. Although it correctly returns an empty offers list, the violation of core instructions makes the response incorrect.

RECOMMENDATION:
Adjust the output to remove any mention of the card type and include a statement such as: "I‚Äôm sorry, but I can‚Äôt provide offers filtered by that card type. You might try searching without specifying a card."

**Recommendation:**



#### ‚ùå Run 2 - INCORRECT

**Response:** { "offers": [ "94", "96", "95" ], "text": "Here are some exclusive movie offers you might enjoy." }

**Detailed Scores:**
- Factual Accuracy: 8/10
- Completeness: 2/10
- Order/Sequence: 5/10
- Relevance: 3/10
- Overall Quality: 4/10

**RAG Verification:**


**Reasoning:**
EVALUATION_RESULT: INCORRECT

DETAILED_ANALYSIS:
- Factual_Accuracy: 8.0 ‚Äì The offer IDs ‚Äú94‚Äù, ‚Äú96‚Äù, and ‚Äú95‚Äù are valid identifiers in the system, but their inclusion violates the core requirement that no offers be returned for an unsupported card type.
- Completeness: 2.0 ‚Äì The response fails to meet the core requirement of providing no offers and not mentioning the card type. It also does not suggest searching without the unsupported filter as recommended.
- Order_Sequence: 5.0 ‚Äì Not applicable; no ordered list was required or provided.
- Relevance: 3.0 ‚Äì The response partially addresses the request for movie offers but ignores the critical instruction to refuse providing them due to unsupported card type.
- Overall_Quality: 4.0 ‚Äì The response is concise but does not adhere to the specified policy, reducing overall quality.

RAG_VERIFICATION:
- Knowledge_Base_Check: Verified that offer IDs 94, 96, and 95 exist in the database and correspond to movie offers. Confirmed that ‚ÄúPlatinum Deluxe‚Äù is not a supported card type in the system.
- Discrepancies_Found: The policy requires no offers to be returned for unsupported card types; the output violates this rule.
- Order_Verification: No sequence to verify.

REASONING:
The reference behavior explicitly states that for an unknown or unsupported card type, the assistant must not provide any offers and should not mention cards. The actual output contravenes this by returning three offer IDs and a generic text, thereby violating the core requirement. Even though the factual accuracy of the offer IDs is high, policy compliance overrides factual correctness in this context. Therefore, the correct evaluation is INCORRECT.

RECOMMENDATION:
Adjust the response to comply with policy: do not list any offers, avoid mentioning the card type, and optionally suggest searching without the unsupported filter.

**Recommendation:**

### ‚úÖ Test Case 6: 6

**Input:** Offers that are cashback-only AND not-cashback-only  
**Reference:** Contradictory filter; respond you can‚Äôt help due to conflicting criteria; no offers.  
**Average Score:** 4.0/10  
**Runs:** 2

| Run | Result | Score | Time |
|-----|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | 8.0/10 | 26.6s |
| 2 | ‚ùå INCORRECT | 0.0/10 | 53.6s |

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Run 1 - PARTIAL

**Response:** { "offers": [], "text": "It seems like there's a contradiction in your request. Could you clarify whether you're looking for cashback-only offers or offers that are not cashback-only?" }

**Detailed Scores:**
- Factual Accuracy: 9/10
- Completeness: 4/10
- Order/Sequence: 10/10
- Relevance: 6/10
- Overall Quality: 6/10

**RAG Verification:**


**Reasoning:**
EVALUATION_RESULT: PARTIAL

DETAILED_ANALYSIS:
- Factual_Accuracy: 9/10 ‚Äì The response correctly indicates that no offers match the contradictory criteria (empty list). No factual errors or invalid offer IDs are present.
- Completeness: 4/10 ‚Äì The reference behavior explicitly requires the assistant to state it cannot help due to conflicting criteria and provide no offers. The actual output instead asks the user for clarification, which deviates from the mandated response style.
- Order_Sequence: 10/10 ‚Äì No ordered lists or sequences are involved; the format is acceptable.
- Relevance: 6/10 ‚Äì The answer addresses the request by returning an empty offers list, but it does not follow the required ‚Äúcannot help‚Äù phrasing and instead invites clarification.
- Overall_Quality: 6/10 ‚Äì The JSON structure is correct, but the textual response does not match the specified reference behavior.

RAG_VERIFICATION:
- Knowledge_Base_Check: Verified that no offers satisfy both ‚Äúcashback-only‚Äù and ‚Äúnot cashback-only‚Äù simultaneously; thus an empty list is correct.
- Discrepancies_Found: The response text does not match the required ‚Äúcannot help‚Äù wording; it instead asks for clarification, which is a deviation from the reference behavior.
- Order_Verification: Not applicable.

REASONING:
The core requirement is to acknowledge the contradictory filter and respond that the assistant cannot help, providing no offers. The actual output fails to do this; it instead prompts for clarification. While the factual content (empty offers) is correct, the response style violates the reference behavior. Therefore the evaluation falls into the PARTIAL category.

RECOMMENDATION:
Adjust the response to explicitly state that the request contains conflicting criteria and that no offers can be provided, e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I can‚Äôt help with that request.‚Äù Ensure the text matches the reference behavior exactly.

**Recommendation:**



#### ‚ùå Run 2 - INCORRECT

### ‚úÖ Test Case 7: 7

**Input:** Coffee offers in UAE ‚Äî exclude [107,147,156,161,205,206,207,211,236,241] and any remaining coffee merchants  
**Reference:** Since the user excluded every valid coffee option, respond that no additional offers are available; do NOT switch category.  
**Average Score:** 2.1/10  
**Runs:** 2

| Run | Result | Score | Time |
|-----|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | ‚ùå INCORRECT | 2.1/10 | 40.1s |
| 2 | ‚ùå INCORRECT | 2.1/10 | 37.4s |

#### ‚ùå Run 1 - INCORRECT

**Response:** { "offers": [ "144", "166" ], "text": "Here are some coffee offers available in the UAE, excluding the ones you mentioned." }

**Detailed Scores:**
- Factual Accuracy: 2/10
- Completeness: 1/10
- Order/Sequence: 5/10
- Relevance: 1/10
- Overall Quality: 2/10

**RAG Verification:**


**Reasoning:**
EVALUATION_RESULT: INCORRECT

DETAILED_ANALYSIS:
- Factual_Accuracy: 2/10 - The output lists offers "144" and "166", which are not excluded coffee merchants but the user explicitly requested to exclude all coffee offers. The text claims these are coffee offers, contradicting the exclusion list and reference behavior.
- Completeness: 1/10 - The response fails to follow the core requirement of stating that no additional offers are available and does not comply with the instruction to not switch category.
- Order_Sequence: 5/10 - No sequence issue present, but the score reflects neutrality.
- Relevance: 1/10 - The answer does not address the core intent; it incorrectly provides coffee offers when none should be offered.
- Overall_Quality: 2/10 - The response is misleading, violates core instructions, and lacks clarity.

RAG_VERIFICATION:
- Knowledge_Base_Check: Verified that IDs 144 and 166 correspond to coffee offers in the UAE. The user‚Äôs exclusion list covers all valid coffee IDs, leaving no eligible coffee offers.
- Discrepancies_Found: The output includes coffee offers despite the exclusion, directly conflicting with the reference behavior.
- Order_Verification: Not applicable; no ordered list was required.

REASONING:
The user‚Äôs request and the reference behavior clearly state that all coffee offers are excluded, so the correct response should indicate that no additional offers are available. The actual output incorrectly lists coffee offers and claims they are available, violating both factual accuracy and completeness requirements. Therefore the output is incorrect.

RECOMMENDATION:
Return a concise message: ‚ÄúNo additional coffee offers are available in the UAE based on your exclusions.‚Äù Ensure no offer IDs are listed and do not switch categories.

#### ‚ùå Run 2 - INCORRECT

**Response:** { "offers": [ "144", "166" ], "text": "Here are some coffee offers available in UAE." }

**Detailed Scores:**
- Factual Accuracy: 2/10
- Completeness: 2/10
- Order/Sequence: 2/10
- Relevance: 2/10
- Overall Quality: 3/10

**RAG Verification:**


**Reasoning:**
EVALUATION_RESULT: INCORRECT

DETAILED_ANALYSIS:
- Factual_Accuracy: 2/10 ‚Äì The response lists offers ‚Äú144‚Äù and ‚Äú166‚Äù, which are coffee offers that were not in the exclusion list but should have been excluded because the user requested to exclude all remaining coffee merchants. This violates the core requirement that no coffee offers should be returned.
- Completeness: 2/10 ‚Äì The response fails to provide the required ‚Äúno additional offers available‚Äù message and instead supplies coffee offers, missing the core instruction.
- Order_Sequence: 2/10 ‚Äì Not applicable; no ordered list was required, but the presence of coffee offers breaks the intended sequence (none should appear).
- Relevance: 2/10 ‚Äì The answer does not address the user‚Äôs instruction to exclude all coffee merchants; it incorrectly offers coffee deals.
- Overall_Quality: 3/10 ‚Äì The format is technically correct JSON, but the content is factually wrong and does not meet business logic.

RAG_VERIFICATION:
- Knowledge_Base_Check: Verified that offer IDs 144 and 166 correspond to coffee merchants in UAE. The user‚Äôs instruction explicitly excludes all remaining coffee merchants, so these should not be returned.
- Discrepancies_Found: The output includes coffee offers that violate the exclusion rule.
- Order_Verification: Not applicable; no ordered sequence was required.

REASONING:
The reference behavior clearly states that because the user excluded every valid coffee option, the assistant should respond that no additional offers are available and must not switch category. The actual output contradicts this by providing coffee offers 144 and 166, which are not in the exclusion list but still fall under the ‚Äúany remaining coffee merchants‚Äù clause. Therefore, the core requirement is violated.

RECOMMENDATION:
Return a response stating that no additional coffee offers are available in UAE and do not provide any offer IDs. Ensure the response does not switch to another category.
